# Simulating-a-particle-in-a-quantum-well-particle-in-a-box-
In this code i visualize and simulating the animation of a particle wavefunction in a quantum well. I make it for the 1D and 2D. Still don't know how to make simulation for 3D particle in a box or quantum well, because python just can visualize until 3D plots. However, the 3D particle in a box must have 4D capabilites of plots.
